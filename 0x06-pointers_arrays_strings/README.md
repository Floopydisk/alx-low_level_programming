# Pointers, arrays and strings (II)
# 0. strcat
A function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.

# 1. strncat
A function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.

# 2. strncpy
A function that copies a string.

Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. Run man strncpy to learn more.

# 3. strcmp
A function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp

# 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
Where n is the number of elements of the array

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
